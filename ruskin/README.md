John Ruskin, art critic, architectural theorist, social commentator and educationalist visited Tunbridge Wells in February 1858 on the invitation of his cousin, to lecture at the Sussex Hotel. At the start of his talk Ruskin explained that he had visited the town, which he called ‘my Switzerland’ as a child and recalled climbing on sandstone cliffs of stupendous height above the common.


Ruskin had grown up in Herne Hill South London a suburb that had much in common with Tunbridge Wells a picture setting and a population of wealthy commercial incomers. His father was a successful wine merchant but was dogged by social insecurity. As a wine merchant he felt superior to the linen drapers and cheesemongers who lived around him though he was very aware that many were wealthier than him yet from a wider perspective, others would consider that he too was in trade.
Ruskin was 39 when he came to Tunbridge Wells. He was by then a well-known writer and commentator. The lecture was said to have been attended by perhaps the most fashionable audience ever assembled there, though it was organised by the Useful Knowledge Institution, a sort of self-improvement group that had grown out of an earlier mechanics institution.

Ruskin’s cousin, William Richardson was living in Tunbridge Wells at Mount Ephraim Rd at this time. He was a doctor at the General Hospital in Grosvenor Rd. Ruskin had come to Tunbridge Wells for his health and stayed with his cousin.  Thomas Carlyle had recommended Tunbridge Wells as a place of area expenses where the wind blows free about one there whilst another friend Pauline Trevelyan considered it an odious place how can you go there
Richardson was a member of the Useful Knowledge Institution and organised the 1858 visit. Ruskin had been lecturing for some time at the workings men college in London. A commentator had suggested that he felt more jeez when addressing audiences of a lower social standing young people women and girls and working-class men.

The audience of 400 was larger than usual, and may have included some of the wealthier inhabitants yet Ruskin seems to have been determined to address social issues as much as art.

It was his style to challenge preconceptions about his subject. In the section iron in nature he focused on iron in the form of rust what he called its living state he reminded the audience of the saffron stain on the chilly beach spring that was so important to the town and claimed that much of the beauty of the British landscape came from the rich rust colour of the bricks and tiles in country cottages. 

‘Iron in art’ allowed him to present two of his favourite ideas that art must result from both feeling and labour and that artists must utilise the particular qualities of their materials iron was workable tenacious and AC tile it could be formed into natural shapes this led to condemnation of iron fencing around houses which he considered exclusionary it said to the passerby you may be an honest person but also you may be a thief honest or not you should not get in here for I am a respectable person and much above you it was a bit contrived a contemporary was equally critical of the high brick walls in Victoria Park, Manchester, which made it feel like a series of private madhouses and surely the thick double hedges in Calverley park gardens we're equally excluding notes by the way that February 1858 saw proposals to exclude the public from Calverley park

The section on iron Impala see was even more political it was built around 3 items the plough the fetter and the sword it was on the plough though and its female equivalent the needle that he really focused they represented labour and what he called a law of nature that wealth and happiness were essentially connected to labour it led to what was effectively a sermon on the oppression of the poor he suggested to his listeners that even they might be guilty of oppressing the poor by looking to buy things cheaply they were stealing from the creators we killed our prayer books with pilfered pence out of children's and sick men's wages
To many in the audience it probably resonated comfortably with recent events in the town. It was a time of distress among the working population earlier that month there had been a demonstration of unemployed men outside the town hall seeking work triggered by this column hall had called a meeting and a labour fund committee was formed to find useful ways of employing them this caused some anguish to the editor of The Gazette while approving of such schemes in general he regretted that action had not been taken earlier it would now look as though they were responding to threats this was the committee that excavated the lake at the bottom of the common the unemployed were paid one and six a day to work on it

there was also a plan put forward by the paving subcommittee of the improvement commissioners who were effectively the town council this proposed that the Commission should borrow £200 to employ unemployed people on other projects around the town the proposal was strenuously opposed by Charles Trustram he believed that the Commission would be acting ultra varies beyond their powers but the projects could be tackled in a more efficient way and that while he understood the charitable motives he did not believe ratepayers money sum collected from poor widows should be spent that way that was what the workhouse was for the proposal was defeated.

Early 1858 was a difficult time a banking collapse in the united states the previous year had spread to europe and its effects for being fast people carries existence at the best of times this is illustrated by a story printed alongside the report of the lecture it suggested that three children living in Wood Street off Camden Rd had died of starvation a letter the following week explained that this was not quite true but it is a troubling story nonetheless. 

Daniel Fry, a plumber. He had worked for a local building firm for a number of years, but had then tried tose up on his own account. It hadn’t worked, and the lack of business was aggravated by illness. He was trying to survive and feed a family of eight on 7 shillings a week from the Hand in Hand Benefit Society. They had been living on bread and cheese, sometimes just bread and butter. One of his children, aged four, developed a throat infection, and, severely malnourished, died a day of so later. A second, ten yeard old, died in the same way; and the next day another, two years old, followed them. Dr Sopwith, on arrival, immediately provided more nutritious food, otherwise, he said, two more would have died. He emphasised that the mother had provided sufficient quantity of food but that it was nutritiously deficient. Canon Hoare arranged for 3 lbs of meat to be supplied. Daniel, it seems, had been a quiet person unwilling to make a fuss and seek help. Three years later the feamily were still living in the area but charlotte, the mother, was recorded as a widow. Danieal too had obviously died. 

As for the Useful Knowledge Institution, it benefitted greatly from Ruskin’s lecture. He didn’t charge a fee so they were able to declare a surplus of £17.5s on the event. The following year they merged with the Literary and Scientific Institution, a smaller group which was losing money. The attraction was that it had premises on the Pantiles, and a small museum. There was also a Belgrave Mechanics Institution at the top end of town with about 150 members. According to its president the secret of its success was that it was managed by, and not for, the mechanics. The president though was that same Charles Trustram – a surgeon not a mechanic.
